                            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aso-offset="300">As artificial intelligence continues to permeate our daily lives, our ability to quantify
                                our trust in a specific decision of an AI system becomes a matter of paramount
                                importance. In this talk, we will briefly cover four interrelated recent results that
                                enable trust in AI: (1) First, we will present the attribution-based confidence (ABC)
                                metrics from our NeurIPS’19 paper and show its relevance as a measure for quantifying
                                trust in neural network decisions (2) Second, we will discuss how neural stochastic
                                differential equations (SDEs) lead to visually sharper and quantitatively robust
                                attributions compared to traditional residual neural networks. (3) Building on this
                                earlier IJCAI’21 work, we will highlight how attributions themselves can be used to
                                shape the noise in neural SDEs and how this leads to more robust attributions (AAAI’22).
                                (4) Finally, we will take a short detour into trust issues in AI hardware and present
                                our flow-based computing architecture (DAC’22) that permits robust computing even on
                                emerging memory devices like memristors.</p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aso-offset="300">Digital images introduced big changes in the world. Besides using digital images in
                                everyday life, they became an irreplaceable part of numerous scientific areas such as
                                medicine, security, agriculture, etc. One of the usual tasks in applications with
                                digital images is digital image classification. Great progress in solving this task was
                                made in recent years by convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks
                                represent a special class of deep neural networks that take a spatial correlation of
                                input data into consideration. The results achieved by CNN are significantly better in
                                comparison with the other classification methods. To use a CNN for a specific
                                classification problem it is necessary to find the optimal network architecture and set
                                various hyperparameters such as the number of different layers, number of neurons in
                                each layer, optimization algorithm, activation functions, kernel size, optimization
                                algorithm, etc. Frequently, CNN’s configuration is based on some previous experience or
                                knowledge or set by guessing and estimating (guestimating) better values for the
                                hyperparameters. Recent studies achieved promising results when using swarm intelligence
                                algorithms for CNN’s hyperparameters tuning. A few examples of using swarm intelligence
                                algorithms for convolutional neural network hyperparameter tuning will be presented.</p>

                                pixel of an object of interest in medical images. An end to end deep learning approach,
                                Convolutional Neural Networks have shown state-of-the-art performance for automated
                                medical image segmentation. However, it doesn’t perform well in case of complex
                                environments. U-Net is another popular deep learning architecture especially for
                                biomedical imaging. In this talk, a concise overview of the modern deep learning model
                                applied in computer vision specifically in medical image analysis is provided and the
                                key tasks performed by deep learning model, i.e., classification and segmentation are
                                shown. Furthermore, we will discuss the thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for
                                segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. Our discussed framework requires no
                                human interaction, no task-specific information, and is based on a fixed model topology
                                and a fixed hyper parameter set.</p>
